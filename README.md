# Cluster and Cloud Computing - Assignment 1

## TODO

- Setup Code Linter

- Run benchmarks via time srun

- Investigate difference between Scatter / Gather and Map / Reduce

## Part 1: Identification of common hashtags

- Identify the top 10 most commonly used hashtags and the number of times they appear. A matching hashtag string can match if it has upper/lower case exact substrings, e.g. #covid19 and #COVID19 are a match. A hashtag should follow the Twitter rules, e.g. no spaces and no punctuation are allowed in a hashtag. 

Any string following a # up until a space or punctuation character is a valid hashtag string (except underscore _). Upper/lower case can still be a match, i.e. '#covid19' and '#COVID19'.

-> Optional: investigate hashtags in user profile description

```
string.punctuation = r"""!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~""" from python
```

## Part 2: Language counting

- Identify the languages used for tweeting and the number of times the language is used for the provided tweets

## Instructions

Submit job by running the command ```sbatch __path_to_slurm_script__```

## Notes

Set each process to read parts of the file (use line delimeter) and gather results in master process.

"Make sure to use a wall size that is neither too long or too short. If to long, it will never get scheduled, and if too short, it will be canceled before finishing.

What if 2 languages or hashtags have the same count number when ranking?  -> Show top 11 hashtags

## SPARTAN partitions

**Cloud**

This partition is best suited for general-purpose single-node jobs. Multiple node jobs will work, but communication between nodes will be comparatively slow.

**Physical**

Each node is connected by high-speed 25Gb networking with 1.15 Âµsec latency, making this partition suited to multi-node jobs (e.g. those using OpenMPI).

You can constrain your jobs to use different groups of nodes (e.g. just the Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6154 CPU @ 3.00GHz nodes) by adding #SBATCH --constraint=physg4 to your submit script

## Troubleshooting

Python/3.7.1 outputs error messages, use Python/3.4.3 instead.

```
No OpenFabrics connection schemes reported that they were able to be used on a specific port As such, the openib BTL (OpenFabrics support) will be disabled for this port.
